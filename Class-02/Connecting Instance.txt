## Connecting to the Instance
    1. Download PuTTY Tool: Ensure PuTTY is installed on your system.
      
    2. Connect to the Instance:
         Select the Linux instance and click on Connect.
         GO to the SSH client.
         There, you can see an example link at the bottom - It consists of the username and password together
         Copy the connection string (username@DNS-name).
      
    3. Open PuTTY Tool:
       a. Paste the connection string in the Host Name field(username@DNS-name).
       b. Navigate to the "+" sign of SSH and then the "+" sign of Auth.
       c. Under the Private key file for authentication, browse and select the test.ppk file.
       d. Click Open.
       e. Accept the security alert to connect to your instance.

    --> PuTTY requires 3 things to connect to the Linux instance that are:
        1. DNS
        2. Username
        3. .ppk file (puTTy's private key)
      
    --> .ppk file is essentially for linux instances not for windows instances.
    --> it is a security file same as .pem file as in Windows.
