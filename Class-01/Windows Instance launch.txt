1. How to build a Windows instance on an EC2 Virtual machine :
  -> First of all login in your AWS account
  -> go to services and select compute
  -> there you will find a service name EC2 (elastic compute cloud), we have already learned about it in our README.md file
  
  # IN EC2 :
    -> On the dashboard you can see every resource as 0 and security group as 1 let it be and click on launch instance.
    # Inside Launch Instance :
      -> Here you  have to follow 7 basic steps every time while creating an instance, the steps are :
        1. number of instances.
        2. name and tag of the instance.
        3. AMI (Amazon Machine Image) i.e. the os for your windows instance.
        4. instance type.
        5. keypair i.e create a key pair and give it a name.
        6. security group i.e for windows instance always choose RDP(remote desktop protocol).
        7. storage i.e allocate storage to the instance.
        8. finally launch the instance or server, you are ready with your windows instance.

2. How to connect to your windows instance :
  -> select the instance that you just launched.
  -> click on connect to connect to your server.
  -> then select RDP client as you are going to connect to window instance.
  -> then download the "remote desktop file" to visually look your server like another remote computer on your machine.
  -> now click on get password, to get password :
    - upload that ".pem" file or paste it's content.
    - decrypt the password to reveal your password.
  -> now open the remote connection application and enter the decrypted password their, confirm it. 
  -> Access your windows instance.

3. Real-Time Use Cases for Windows Instances:-
    1. DevOps Tools: Install and work on various DevOps tools.
    2. Application Testing: Test applications on servers with different configurations.
    3. E-Commerce: Used by large e-commerce companies and markets for complex calculations.
    4. Game Development: Develop and run games that require high-performance servers.
    5. Graphics and Visual Effects: Work on high-definition graphics and visual effects for movie production.
    6. Additional Use Cases: Windows instances can be used for many other specialized tasks that require high configuration andreliability.
